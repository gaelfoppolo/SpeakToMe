### Speech Recognition

This example project demonstrates the usage of the new **Speech Recognition API** introduced in iOS 10. 

This is a modified sample code from [WWDC 2016 (session 509)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/509) on speech recognition.

## How it works?

[I wrote a short article](https://blog.gaelfoppolo.com/speech-framework-in-ios-10-99affac88ba7) about how to use Speech Recognition.

Open an issue if you want more information :)
